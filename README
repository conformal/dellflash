THIS TOOL IS FOR USER CONVENIENCE ONLY.  IT IS NOT WRITTEN BY DELL AND ALL
RESPONSIBILITY LAYS WITH THE USER.  IF YOU BRICK YOUR BOX YOU OWN IT. DO NOT
BLAME ANYONE BUT YOURSELF.  WHEN IN DOUBT DON'T USE IT.  REALLY DON'T USE IT.

Boot the machine into securelevel -1 (set in /etc/rc.securelevel)

Ensure that there is a fresh kernel source checked out on the build machine.

Change into the dellflash directory and s root run the following commands:
make
make load
flashit/flashit pv1950_2.6.1.hdr
reboot

In this example it will load the Dell PowerEdge 1950 to BIOS 2.6.1 flash
image into memory.  Upon reboot the server will flash the BIOS.

Remember to set securelevel back to its normal value!

There are several ways to obtain the BIOS hdr files.
1. http://linux.dell.com/repo/firmware/bios-hdrs/
	this require one to match the BIOS to product ID.  For example
	pcidump -v | grep 1028
		0x002c: Subsystem Vendor ID: 1028 Product ID: 024f
	then find the .hdr directory with 0x024f and download bios.hdr
	Note: this repository isn't always up to date!

2. Download the .exe BIOS update for windows from support.dell.com and from
	a windows box run it like:
	PE1950_BIOS_WIN_2.6.1.exe /s /e=2.6.1
	then in the 2.6.1 directory find the .hdr file (might be in a payload
	directory as well)
	- or -
	laptops or desktops sometimes can be run like:
	E6500A16.EXE /writehdrfile
	in this example the executable writes E6500A16.hdr
	- or -
	install dosbox: pkg_add dosbox
	run it by simply typing: dosbox
	mount the directory where you downloaded the .EXE file, for example:
	mount c /tmp
	goto new mounted drive by typing: C:
	then you can run the same command as above: E6500A16.EXE /writehdrfile

3. Download the .BIN BIOS update for linux from support.dell.com and on any
	machine edit the file in your favorite (NON WINDOWS!!) editor.
	Find the line that reads: #####Startofpackage#####^M
	and delete everything, including that line, in front of it.  Write
	the remaining file with a .tgz extension.
	Untar the tgz file that was generated and go find the .hdr file which
	again might be in a payload directory.
